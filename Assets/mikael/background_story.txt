Prologue
At the dawn of time, the creator of all things crafted worlds beyond counting. Among them was one tiny ball of rock and soil. On this fleck of dirt he planned to make one species to outshine all his other creations. The pinnacle of his glory. However, when he was almost done he was interrupted... "Dinner is ready!". Damn, he thought, must she always interrupt when I'm in the middle of something. "I'm coming, mom!".
And so it was, that his creation was left half done. The 'Humans', which he had created was not fully developed and left with defective intellectual capacity and lacking properly configured morals. Taking pity on the incomplete creation, one of the other species took pity on the humans and took it upon themselves to care for them. The Space Dolphins!
Now, 6000 years later, the Dolphins of planet earth have averted disasters countless of times over history by secretly manipulating the humans and turning events in their favor. For without the dolphins, the humans would surely have gone extinct a long time ago.
This time, a brave young Space Dolphin named Dolphin Lundgren has to prevent the piteously dull witted President Trump from posting ill-conceived messages on Twitter. If enough of his absurd posts go through, he will provoke the outrage of other leaders and disaster will surely follow.
So now it falls to Dolphin Lundgren to intercept any messages sent by the muddled President by tracking and stoping the transmissions.

<Instructions> Dolphin Lundgren can cancel out the radio waves by using his sonic disruptor powers. Dive down to earth and shoot down the radio waves before they reach the radio towers in North Korea. If enough radio waves go through (indicated by the red meter), Kim Jong Un will fire his missiles towards USA and many of the poor humas will die.</Instructions>
